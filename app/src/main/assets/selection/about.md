# About SelectionSort

It is an unstable sorting algorithm with complexity $$ O(n^2) $$. Compared to other algorithms
of similar complexity (eg BubbleSort) is faster but slower than InsertionSort.

## Principle

This algorithm sequentially selects the smallest and largest elements and moves them to the beginning of the rest of the array. After sorting the element, the field shrinks
by one and ignores sorted positions.
