# About BubbleSort

It is a simple and stable sorting algorithm.

## Principle

It got its name thanks to the method of sorting, which can be compared to bubbles, which, if lighter, rise faster in the water.
It compares two numbers side by side in turn, and the smaller one is always swapped so that it is closer to the end of the list and continues with the same logic on other indexes.
At the end of the iteration, the smallest number (ie in place) is sorted at the end of the list in this way, and a new iteration begins without this last iteration.

## Algorithm complexity

BubbleSort belongs to the group of complexity $$ O(n^2) $$, and it is a very time-consuming algorithm.
Shifting time per 1,000,000 numbers is estimated from 45 minutes to 2.5 hours depending on the performance of the device.
